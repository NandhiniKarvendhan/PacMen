# PacMen

In Pacmen project, we are creating a web page that produces a PacMan on
the click of a button by using the array methods and manipulating the
DOM. In webpage when "Add PacMan" button is clicked, a new pacman
appears on the screen. When "Start Game" button is clicked, the pacman
or pacmen created start to move across the screen.
